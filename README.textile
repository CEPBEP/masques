h2. Masques

Masques is a P2P social network. Instead of posting your personal data on a website which you don't control and which
changes their privacy policy on a whim, all of your data stays on your computer, and is only shared with the friends you
want to share it with. All communication is directly from friend to friend (node to node) and encrypted to avoid
unwanted eyes viewing your data.

h3. Usage

Masques is still under development and there is no easy way to install and run it at the moment.

From development:

Make sure you have I2P installed and running on you computer.

Make sure you have java and Leiningen installed.

Check out the code and download the dependencies with "lein deps". To run in development mode use "lein development".
